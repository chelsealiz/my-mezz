                <p>Charlottesville, Virginia - June 2, 2014 – <a href="http://www.arl.org">SHARE</a> (SHared Access
                    Research Ecosystem) and the <a href="http://cos.io">Center for
                    Open Science</a> (COS), a Charlottesville, Virginia–based nonprofit technology start-up, have agreed to
                    form a partnership to build the SHARE Notification Service, which will provide notice that research
                    is available to the public.</p>
                <p>SHARE is a collaborative initiative of the Association of Research Libraries (ARL), the Association
                    of American Universities (AAU), and the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities (APLU),
                    created to ensure the preservation of, access to, and reuse of research results. The Notification
                    Service, to be built over the next 18 months, is SHARE’s first project.</p>
                <p>The Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation have generously
                    provided grant funding to develop the open source Notification Service, which will enable scholars,
                    funders, university research offices, institutional and disciplinary repositories, and the public to
                    identify when a publication, data set, or other research output is available. </p>
                <p>Interested parties have found it difficult to keep abreast of the release of publications, data sets,
                    and other results of scholarly research. Across the disciplines, principal investigators and other
                    scholars do not have any single, structured way to report these releases in a timely and comprehensive
                    manner. The SHARE Notification Service is a higher education-based initiative to strengthen efforts
                    to identify, discover, and track research outputs. </p>
                <p>The COS’s mission to foster openness, integrity, and reproducibility of research is well aligned with
                    SHARE’s objectives. Andrew Sallans, COS partnerships manager, has participated in SHARE’s Technical
                    Working Group since November 2013.</p>
                <p>“We are excited to partner with ARL, AAU, and APLU on this important community effort,” Sallans said.
                    “This is a great opportunity to collectively build a solution that will serve many stakeholders
                    across the entire research process.” </p>
                <p>The Notification Service will make use of the <a href="http://osf.io">Open Science Framework</a> (OSF), COS’s existing, free,
                    open-source platform designed to connect the scholarly workflow.</p>
                <p>“We strongly believe that ensuring broad and continuing access to research is central to the mission
                    of higher education,” ARL executive director Elliott Shore said. “We are thrilled to partner with
                    the Center for Open Science in this endeavor. Their mission is in sync with ours and their talents
                    are exactly what we need to make the SHARE Notification Service a success.”</p>
                <p>AAU executive vice president John Vaughn said, “We are delighted that SHARE has reached this important
                    milestone in its plan to provide timely public access to the results of research. COS is well suited
                    to help SHARE carry out this project.”</p>
                <p>“We are very pleased that the SHARE Notification Service is moving forward and are excited to have the
                    Center for Open Science as a partner,” APLU vice president and chief academic officer Michael Tanner
                    said. “Working with COS will help us ensure that university research findings are easily accessible
                    to the public and can be used to advance society and develop new breakthroughs.”</p>
